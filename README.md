# CoverLetterApplication
A desktop application that generates tailored cover letters using user-provided details, job descriptions, and resumes. The generated cover letters can be reviewed, edited, and exported as PDFs. Users may also provide additional context or make refinements after the initial generation.
The current limitation is that PDF output uses a simple layout and does not yet support visual templates.

## Purpose:
Applying for jobs has become increasingly repetitive and time consuming. While manually writing cover letters adds a personal touch, it often yields little response likely due to automated screening systems filtering applications before they reach a human reviewer.

This application is designed to strike a balance between efficiency and authenticity. Rather than fully automating job applications or scraping postings, it enables a fast, repeatable workflow where each cover letter is still reviewed and refined by the user. The goal is to reduce friction in the application process while maintaining intentional human oversight and customization.

It provides a rapid iteration loop for high-quality, role-specific cover letters without removing the applicant from the process.
